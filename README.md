A programming language with unbelievable speed, syntax and security.

> **Warning**: This programming language is a joke - please do not use for actual projects.

## Unbelievable speed

This programming language has some unbelieveable speeds! Compared to python, it can be up to 2x slower! Few programming languages can come close to that kind of speed.

## Amazing syntax

This syntax is so great it might as well be english! All sorts of confusing symbols and terms.

## Security

This programming language is one of the most secure. Why? Anyone who reads it will instantly run as far away from the computer as they can!

# FAQs

# Documentation

If you actually want to use this, here's a short guide on how it works.

To declare a variable:
```py
_ var_name : "Hello, World" ;
```
Fairly simple.

If you want to print said variable:
```py
_ var_name : "Hello, World" ;
+ print : var_name, ;
```

Simple program to count 0-9:
```py
_ iterator : "0", ;

* while : iterator != "10" {
    + print : iterator, ;
    * if : iterator == "3" {
        + print : "3 is a nice number", ;
    }
    _ iterator : + sum : iterator, "1", ; ;
}
```
You can run each file as a function, for example if you have a file called `function.june` you can run it using `+ function.june :;`
